mind  dont mean to say that  know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a doornail  might have been inclined myself to regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the countrys done for you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a door nail scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for  dont know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
